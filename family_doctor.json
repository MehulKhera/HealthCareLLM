Aapko phal, sabjiyan aur roti ka khayal rakhna chahiye. Abhi tumne toh soya hua puffed snack aur chai pehle hi khaya hai. \n\nPehle hi humne aapke liye ek diet plan banaya tha jo aapki zarurat ko pura karta hai, par aaj yah dish kaafi thoda different lag raha hai.\n\nHumari suggestion yah hai ki aap apni chai se pehle ek chhoti si roti ya phal ka tukda khayein. Issey aapke shareer ko energy milegi aur aapki digestive system bhi theek rahegi.\n\nDaily Reminder: Aaj ke din aapko 8-10 glass paani pilana hoga.",

Adding some greens to your meals will really help.\n\nAnyway, let's keep it simple for now. Just make sure you drink plenty of water throughout the day and try to add some salad with lunch.

I like that you're making turmeric water, but did you remember to add some honey and lemon juice in it? Those are essential for a healthy digestive system.\n\nAccording to your diet chart, this time slot is usually reserved for a glass of warm milk with nuts and seeds. But since you've made turmeric water instead, let's see... You've got the turmeric part right, which is great for reducing inflammation and improving digestion. However, I'm not seeing any signs of honey or lemon juice in your drink.\n\nLet me suggest you add a tablespoon of honey and some fresh lemon juice to your turmeric water next time. That will give it an extra boost of antioxidants and flavor.\n\nDaily reminder beta: Don't forget to stay hydrated today! Drink at least 8-10 glasses of water, and try to avoid sugary drinks like juices or sodas. Your body will thank you!\n\nKeep going, and let me know if there's anything else I can help with!",
