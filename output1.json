  "I see you've sent a picture of methi seeds soaked in water! Great job with that, I can see from the diet chart that's exactly what was suggested for your morning snack.\n\nJust to confirm, is it done according to the recipe? Soaked overnight, boiled next morning, and consumed at room temperature?",
  "Hey there! I see you've shared an image of \"One bowl vegetable upma\". This dish seems to be a great choice, but let's compare it with what we have in your diet chart for this time (08:30 AM).\n\nAccording to your meal plan, you're supposed to have poha, coriander chutney, and toned milk at breakfast. While your vegetable upma does contain veggies, it's missing the poha and milk. Also, make sure to add a dollop of curd on top for extra probiotics!\n\nConsidering you've been doing great with soaking methi seeds and snacking on dry fruits, I'd suggest adding some nuts or seeds to your upma next time to boost its nutritional value.\n\nKeep it up! You're on the right track.",
  "Arre yeh breakfast ki kuch problem hai! I see a mixture of potatoes, oats, and nuts in the photo, but it's not exactly what we planned for breakfast.\n\nAccording to our diet chart, you should have had Apple Cinnamon Overnight Oats for breakfast. The one in the photo seems to be a different recipe. We need to stick to our plan to help manage your PCOS symptoms.\n\nAlso, don't forget to drink a glass of lukewarm jeera water after dinner and have an apple cinnamon overnight oats as your breakfast tomorrow.\n\nBy the way, how's your weight today? You mentioned it was 73.4 kg after clearing your stomach. Let's work together to get back on track!",
  "Here's a possible response:\n\n\"Looks good! You're following the plan for breakfast with Poha, Coriander Chutney, and Toned Milk. Just a reminder to add some chopped veggies to your poha as mentioned in the meal plan. And don't forget to have milk without sugar after 25 minutes of eating.\"",
  "**Query Response**\n\nYou've sent an image of your morning meal, but it seems like you've skipped some essential items from the diet chart.\n\nAccording to the plan, for **7:00 AM**, you should have:\n\n* Cinnamon Water\n* Soaked Almond\n* Soaked Walnut\n\nHowever, I see a white mug filled with a red beverage ( Spearmint Tea) on your plate. While tea is part of your evening meal, it's not included in the morning plan.\n\nTo ensure compliance and support your weight management goals, please add:\n\n* Cinnamon Water to your drink\n* Soaked Almond\n* Soaked Walnut to your snack\n\nRemember to maintain a gap of 30 minutes between meals for better nutrient absorption. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",
  "Here's a response to the patient's latest query:\n\n\"Hey! I see you've sent an image of your breakfast (Upma/Khichdi). That looks good, but let's make sure it aligns with our diet plan.\n\nFor Breakfast at 09:00 AM, we had planned for Wheat Flakes With Milk. While upma/khichdi is a great option, I'd suggest adding some veggies to it to boost fiber intake and keep you fuller till lunch.\n\nAlso, have you had your Lemon Chia Seeds Water yet? That's an essential part of our breakfast plan. Please make sure to drink that before starting your day.\n\nLet me know if you need any more clarification or help with anything else.\"",
  "Here's a concise and actionable response to the patient's latest query:\n\n\"Great choice with pomegranate, sesame seeds, and sunflower seeds! However, I noticed you mentioned 1 spoon of each, but ideally, we should be consuming more seeds for optimal benefits. Let's try increasing the quantity to 2 spoons of each (sesame and sunflower seeds). Also, remember to have it with an apple as we discussed earlier. Keep it up!\"",
  "You've asked for 1 Nariyal Panni (coconut water)! \n\nLet me check if this fits with your weight management plan... According to today's diet chart, you had Green Tea at Evening time. I don't see Coconut Water mentioned in your dinner or snack options.\n\nFor weight management, it's essential to stick to the planned meals and avoid adding extra items that can affect your calorie intake. However, since Coconut Water is a hydrating option, let's modify this for now: you can have 1 Nariyal Panni as an additional drink after your lunch meal, but not as a replacement for any other meal or snack.\n\nPlease remember to stick to the planned meals and portion sizes mentioned in the diet chart. If you need help or clarification on anything, feel free to ask!",
  "\"Hey! Your idly with chutney looks delicious, but let's check if it fits our meal plan for now. For lunch (02:00 PM), we had planned Wheat And Jowar Roti, Mixed Vegetable, Zeera Raita, and Tomato Cucumber Salad. Can you try to include some of these items in your meal today? Also, since you're on a non-veg diet preference, let's focus on adding some protein-rich foods like eggs or chicken to make it more balanced. Remember to drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially with constipation issues\"",
  "Based on your query, I see you've had a meal with stuffed paratha, green chutney, boiled eggs in curry, sliced cucumbers, and buttermilk with mint and cumin. \n\nFor lunch (01:30 PM), I suggested having Oats Roti with Lauki Chane Ki dal, Zeera Raita, and Tomato Cucumber Salad. It looks like you've had a similar meal, but with some variations.\n\nGreat effort on adding veggies and coriander chutni! However, it would be perfect if you could add the suggested Zeera Raita and Tomato Cucumber Salad to your meal. You can also consider replacing the stuffed paratha with Oats Roti for better nutritional benefits.\n\nKeep up the good work!",
  "**Compliance Check**\n\nI see you've had a bowl of papaya with sesame seeds and sunflower seeds (Meal 11:30am). Your diet chart for today has Apple cinnamon overnight oats listed for Breakfast (10:00 AM). It looks like you missed out on your breakfast meal! \n\nFor Meal 11:30am, it seems you're missing the Mid Meal (11:00 AM) suggested in your plan, which includes Pomegranates and coconut water. Would you like to add that to your meal?\n\nYour drink of Buttermilk is in compliance with your diet plan.\n\nKeep following your meal plan, and let me know if you need any help or have questions!",
  "Based on your latest query, I see a plate of paneer (white cheese). According to your diet chart for Friday, dated 14-06-2024, at **Lunch (02:00 PM)**, you should have had Bajra roti, plain toor dal, curd, and tomato cucumber salad. \n\nCompliance check:\n* You're missing the bajra roti, toor dal, curd, and tomato cucumber salad.\n* There's an extra paneer.\n\nConsidering your medical profile and recent chat history, I would suggest adding some complex carbs like bajra roti and protein-rich foods like toor dal along with the curd and salad. This will provide a balanced meal as per your diet chart.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
  "Hey there!\n\nI see you've shared a picture of your Lunch meal. Let's break it down according to your diet chart.\n\nYour Lunch should ideally consist of Oats Roti, Urad Chana Dal, Curd, and Tomato Cucumber Salad. I see you have flatbreads (possibly chapati or roti), a bowl of curry, and a bowl of yogurt or raita in the picture. While these items are mostly on track, I do notice that you're missing the Oats Roti, which is a crucial part of your meal. Also, it's great that you've included Curd, but make sure to have Tomato Cucumber Salad as well!\n\nAs someone with PCOS and Weight Management goals, incorporating fiber-rich foods like oats and veggies will help regulate your blood sugar levels and support weight loss.\n\nLet's get back on track! Would you mind trying to include the Oats Roti in your next meal?",
  "Mam, I see you added the raita later! For your next meal, please make sure to include it with the Moong Dal and Oats Roti for lunch. Also, don't forget to have a glass of Lukewarm Lemon water in the evening to help regulate your periods. And remember, we discussed adding onion tomato salad to dinner, so please add that too!",
  "Hey! I see you've sent a picture of Makhana Chaat, but according to your diet chart, it's supposed to be had at 05:00 PM. Not bad though! Also, I don't see any mention of milk in your lunch meal at 02:30 PM, did you have 1 glass milk then?",
  "The meal you sent looks great, but let's see if it aligns with our diet plan.\n\nFor lunch at 2:00 PM, the ideal meal from our chart is Wheat And Jowar Roti, Mixed Vegetable, Zeera Raita, and Tomato Cucumber Salad. It seems like you've opted for Moong dal, little cabbage, and jowar roti instead.\n\nGreat job on incorporating some veggies! However, I would recommend adding the Zeera Raita and Tomato Cucumber Salad to balance your meal. Also, consider having a small serving of Curd to get those probiotics in.\n\nRemember, with your asthma and hypertension, it's essential to keep your diet light and balanced. This will help manage symptoms and promote overall well-being.\n\nStick to our plan and make adjustments as needed. Keep up the good work!",
  "\"Hey, looks like you're enjoying makhana and spearmint tea! That's great! However, I noticed it's Roasted Salted Makhana that's suggested for Evening (05:00 PM) snack in your diet chart. Also, did you remember to sprinkle sesame seeds and sunflower seeds on your apple as per the Mid Meal suggestion? Let's stick to the plan and make adjustments if needed!\"",
  "Hey! I've checked your meals for today. You had bhindi and oats roti for lunch, which is okay but not ideal according to the diet chart. We were supposed to have paneer stuffed moong dal cheela and coriander chutney.\n\nFor snacks, you had 2 apple pealed right now, but ideally, we should be eating guavas or other fruits like papaya, pomegranate, etc. \n\nAlso, don't worry about not clicking pictures due to office hours; just remember the portions and try to stick to them tomorrow.\n\nLet's discuss this more during our next chat session.",
  "\"Hey! I see you sent a pic of your dinner, but it looks like the paneer stuffed moong dal cheela and coriander chutney are missing from your plate? Stick to the diet plan and make sure to have those as part of your lunch meal. You can add some veggies on top of the tofu stir-fry for an extra nutrient boost! Keep going, you got this!\"",
  "Here's a concise and actionable response to the patient's latest query:\n\n\"Hey, I see you had lemon tea with dinner! That's great, but remember our diet plan said Spearmint Tea for evening, right? Make sure to stick to that from now on. Also, did you notice you missed the sesame seeds and sunflower seeds that were supposed to be part of your evening meal?\"",
  "Apne query ke anusar, maine dekha ki aapne \"Jeera water or Souf water add nh kr skte kya?\" isey puchha hai.\n\nMeal ek hi: Dinner (08:00 PM)\nIdeal Meal: Daliya With Green Beans aur Mint Chutney\nKhaaya Hua: [koi baat nahi]\n\nTumhein achi tarah se samajhne ki zarurat nahin hai.

  "\"Hey, for your Night drink (10:00 PM), it seems like you're looking to have Ajwain water! That's perfect. Just remember to take 1 tsp of ajwain in 1 glass of water, boil it, sieve, and have it at normal temperature. It'll help with digestive discomforts and improve your metabolic rate.\"",
  "The image you sent shows a cup with brown liquid, but it says \"Turmeric water\". I think there might be some confusion! In our previous conversation, we discussed making turmeric water by boiling water and adding a pinch of turmeric powder, then letting it cool. It looks like you're having tea or coffee instead.\n\nRemember to stick to your diet plan for the best results. Why don't you try making the correct turmeric water according to our previous chat?"
