HealthCareLLM- An LLM which makes sure patients are guided swiftly and efficiently through responses generated by a collaboration of information from:

1. Their diet chart meals(to ensure they are eating the right things in specific meals.
   
2. The general notes assigned to them by the doctor(specific to each patient).

3. The notes assigned with each meal(to ensure that the meal is taken the correct way).

4. The timing associated with each meal(so that they have their meals at the right time).

Model used- Llama 3.1 from Ollama(locally). Even more accuracy and closeness to the ideal_responses can be achieved by using paid APIs. This project is solely based on use of Open Source LLMs.

I have run 2 different codes- just to ensure the response is better. Final code is in new.ipynb file and the final output is in final_output.json file.

STEPS TO RUN:


1. Just create a virtual environment in VS Code and run the ipynb file. Simple.
